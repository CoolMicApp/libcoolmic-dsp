 * This file defines basic interface to access a real (hardware) or
 * virtual (software) sound device.
 * The API is designed so it works with sound devices opned for reading (recording),
 * writing (playback) or both at the same time (full duplex access).
 * To read data from the device use the IO Handle as provided by this API.
 * To write data to the device attach an IO handle and call the iteration function.
